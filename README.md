## Project Overview

This repository includes various types of interview questions typically asked in technical interviews. The topics covered include, but are not limited to:

- Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, etc.)
- Algorithms (Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, etc.)
- System Design Concepts
- Coding Exercises and Problem-Solving Strategies

Each question has a solution file along with an explanation to help users understand the approach and logic.
